# 📄 Compare PDF Files for Identical Content using Python

This project provides a simple yet powerful Python script to **compare two PDF files** and determine whether their contents are identical by generating and comparing **SHA-1 hashes**.

## 🎯 Project Title

**Comparing PDF Documents for Identical Content using Python**

---

## 🧠 Aim

To develop a Python script that compares two PDF files by calculating their cryptographic hash values and identifying whether they are identical.

---

## 📝 Description

This Python project efficiently compares the content of two PDF documents using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. It calculates a unique hash for each file and checks if the files match by comparing these hashes. This approach is lightweight, reliable, and works regardless of the PDF file size or complexity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Build a Python script that reads and hashes PDF files using SHA-1.
2. Compare the resulting hashes of two PDF files.
3. Confirm whether the files are identical based on their hash values.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: `hashlib` (built-in)
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

---

## 🧪 Implementation Details

The `hash_file` function reads each PDF in **binary mode**, processes it in **1024-byte chunks**, and generates a **SHA-1 hash**. After both files are hashed, their hex-digests are compared.

### 🔁 Algorithm

1. Open both PDF files in binary mode.
2. Use `hashlib.sha1()` to initialize hash objects.
3. Read both files in chunks (1024 bytes) to avoid memory overload.
4. Update hash values with each chunk.
5. Compare the final hexadecimal digests of both files.

## 🧾 Sample Code

```python
import hashlib

def hash_file(fileName1, fileName2):
    h1 = hashlib.sha1()
    h2 = hashlib.sha1()

    with open(fileName1, "rb") as file:
        chunk = 0
        while chunk != b'':
            chunk = file.read(1024)
            h1.update(chunk)

    with open(fileName2, "rb") as file:
        chunk = 0
        while chunk != b'':
            chunk = file.read(1024)
            h2.update(chunk)

    return h1.hexdigest(), h2.hexdigest()

# Compare files
msg1, msg2 = hash_file("pd1.pdf", "pd2.pdf")
if msg1 != msg2:
    print("These files are not identical")
else:
    print("These files are identical")
````

## ▶️ How to Run

### Prerequisites:

* Python 3 installed on your system

### Steps:

1. Place your two PDF files in the same directory as the script.
2. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python compare_pdfs.py
```

3. You will see an output like:

```
These files are not identical
```

Or:

```
These files are identical
```

## 📷 Screenshots (Optional)

You can include screenshots in a `/screenshots` folder to visually show:

* The PDFs being compared
* The terminal output

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to verify whether two PDF documents are identical by using SHA-1 hashing. It offers a practical tool for **file integrity verification** and has potential applications in **document comparison**, **plagiarism detection**, or **backup validation**.
